# Relative XP
A mod for Minecraft that relativizes the costs of enchanting and anvil combining.

- Enchanting tables consume the points cost equivalent to levelling up from the requirement to the addition of the level cost
  - For example, a level 30 enchant requiring 3 levels will cost 306 points (points required to reach level 30 from 27)
- Anvils consume the  points cost equivalent to leveling up from 0 to the level cost
  - For example, an 8 level cost will cost 112 points (points required to reach level 8 from 0)
