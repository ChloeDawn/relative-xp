# Relative XP
A mod for Minecraft that relativizes the costs of enchanting and anvil combining.

- Enchanting tables consume the points cost between the minimum required level and the subtraction of the level cost
  - For example, a level 30 enchant requiring 3 levels will cost 306 points (points between level 27 and 30)
- Anvils consume the  points cost between level 0 and the level cost
  - For example, an 8 level operation will cost 112 points (points between level 0 and 8)
